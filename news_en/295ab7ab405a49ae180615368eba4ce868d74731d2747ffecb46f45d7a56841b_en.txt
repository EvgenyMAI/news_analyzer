With the approach of the Central Bank meeting, the inflation factor for OFZ investors will grow
Demand for OFZ last week has been preserved-the curve decreased by another 9-20 b.(11.57% on papers and 11.72% - Plant).Purchases were supported by the further positive dynamics of the ruble to strengthen the factor of the tax period.Demand at the auctions of the Ministry of Finance for long OFZ with a fixed rate steadily maintained above 100 billion rubles.Since the beginning of November (November 22, the demand for the 15-year issue amounted to 136 billion rubles).

At the same time, on Friday, the market was observed on the market after the release of data on inflation expectations the day before - the inflation assessment, which citizens expect in a year, increased to 12.2 from 11.2% a month earlier.

In the first half of the current week, the factor of strengthening the ruble on tax payments will support OFZ, but we do not expect significant growth of quotations from current levels - with the approach of the Central Bank meeting, investors will pay more and more attention to the outgoing inflation data.So far, due to the preservation of the inflation impulse in the economy, the risk of additional increase in the key rate in December remains increased.
