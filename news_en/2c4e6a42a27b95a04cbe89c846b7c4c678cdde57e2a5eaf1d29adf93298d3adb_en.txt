Gazprom shares.Fiasco or ..?
Tolerate the fiasco - fail.The expression is a half -piece with the French Faire Fiasko.Italian fiasco - "bottle".The expression is associated with an unsuccessful attempt by the famous Italian comedian Biankonelli to play a cheerful pantomime with a large bottle in his hand before the public.(Portal Gramota.ru)



The price of PAO Gazprom approached the levels of the 2008 minimums.Such a result in 16 years deserves attention, given the size of the company, the number of investors and the amount of the destroyed cost:







Do not compare Gazprom c nvidia (nasdaq :) Corp.And remember the loud promises of management.We will try to identify the main reason for the failure with capitalization and assume options for the development of events.In our opinion, the main blow, the consequences of which were reflected in the price of shares are the loss of the European gas market.In 2021, all the exports of Gazprom amounted to 206 billion cubic meters.m, including in the far abroad, that is, mainly to Europe and Turkey, 185 billion cubic meters.m.



In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects to stabilize the pipeline supplies of Russian gas to Europe at the level of last year, that is, about 45 billion cubic meters.m. According to the results of 2023, gas exports to China for Siberia amounted to 22.7 billion cubic meters.m.

The forecast of the IEA should be considered as extremely optimistic against the background of current real sentiments in Europe, the supply of pipeline gas can decrease even more.The question with China rests on the maximum throughput of Siberia-1 force in the amount of 38 billion cubic meters.According to the results of a recent visit to China at the highest level about the Pipeline, the power of Siberia-2 was not said.



The ratio of the above excludes the possibility of compensating for the incomes in the next two to three years, because the deployment of replacing alternative projects and their access to full power will require at least several years.So, Gazprom (MCX :) are obviously difficult times, it is no coincidence that even in the State Duma a forecast of the probable 1 trillion rubles was made in the State Duma.Losses in 2024.



Summary.

How will the price of shares be reacted to such a set?The picture looks objectively gloomy, the fall is really really lower than 110-120 rubles.
