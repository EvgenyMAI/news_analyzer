A canopy in replacing bonds is canceled
On December 18, the President of the Russian Federation signed a decree according to which the deadline for replacing Eurobligations by local releases is extended until July 1, 2024.Emiots had to be in time before January 1, 2024.The reason for the extension is that many companies did not have time to replace in 2023.



The following companies managed to replace the following companies from the non -financial sector: Gazprom (MCX :), LUKOIL (MCX :), MMK (mcx :), Sovcomflot (MCX :), metalinvest, wrestler, fosagro (MCX :), NORCEL (MCX :), Nordgold.In the process of replacement is NLMK (MCX :).From the financial sector-2 issues of Alfa Bank, Tinkoff (MCX :)GTLK and SOCCOMBANK (MCX :) will finish the replacement of all their Eurobonds until the end of the year.

In 1P 2024, Alrosa (MCX :), Paul (MCX :), Domodedovo, Siber, TMK (MCX :) and Russian Railways from the non -financial sector (MCX :), Home Bank and VTB (MCX :).There will probably be a VEB, but the company gave a comment that he hopes to receive the release from the Ministry of Finance from replacement.

The bulk of the following coupon payments for the papers of these issuers falls on the March May.Thus, the peak of substitutions will have to be on February-April, as we think that the issuers will produce local bonds before the date of the coupon payment, at least such a practice was in 2022 and 2023.

We consider this a positive factor for investors, as we expect that the ruble in 1P of 2024 will be stronger than today, which will give a good entry point in terms of ruble price.
