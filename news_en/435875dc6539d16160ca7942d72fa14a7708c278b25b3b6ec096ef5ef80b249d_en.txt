Low liquidity of the OFZ market contributes to increased volatility of trading
The activity of trading on the first working day of 2024 increased, but remained below the average December values ​​- the volume of trading in amounted to 3.3 billion rubles.Compared to 9.5 billion rubles.On average for December.The low liquidity of the market, which is likely to remain before the end of the current week will contribute to increased volatility of trading.

So, yesterday, with a fairly positive market conjuncture associated with the strengthening of the ruble, the profitability of medium-term and long OFZs increased by 9-22 B.P., returning to the level of 12.0% per annum.From next week, the auctions of the Ministry of Finance begin, which will absorb the main amount of demand for long paper.As a result, we expect to preserve profitability through long bonds near current levels.

In general, the strategy for the first quarter remains the preservation of the prevailing share of the floors in the portfolio (~ 70%).The extension of medium -term and long papers with a fixed bet will probably become appropriate in the spring when the signals appear to stabilize inflation.
