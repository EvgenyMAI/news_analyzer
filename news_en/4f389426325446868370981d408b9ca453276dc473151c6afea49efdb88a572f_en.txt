The US court canceled the SEC rule to increase the transparency of hedge funds
Getblock Magazine - What happened?The US Appeal Court canceled the Decree of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which obliges hedge funds and private investment companies to increase transparency in the issue of their commission and expenses.The court noted that such a requirement of the SEC exceeded its authority.

The court's decision

What else is known?On June 5, a collegium of three judges unanimously made a decision against the SEC on a complaint filed by six industry groups.According to them, the rule adopted by the regulator in August last year increases compliance expenses and significantly changes the methods of work of companies.

SEC demanded from the funds to publish quarterly reports on the results of activities and commission fees, conduct annual audits and "stop providing special attention to some investors."

Then the SEC stated that the Congress expanded the role of the Commission for Supervision of private funds thanks to the law of the Dodd Frank, adopted for the restructuring of the financial sector after the financial crisis of 2008.

However, the court rejected the SEC arguments, in which she quoted the norms of this law to justify her influence on the sector, noting that not one of the points of the document provides the SEC of such powers.“The adoption of the rules was unauthorized, not a single part of them can remain in force,” the court decision says.

SEC is known for its approach to regulating the cryptosector through forced measures, and in particular the filing of claims.However, the recent actions of the Congress can significantly limit its powers in the future.So, last month, the House of Representatives adopted a law on financial innovations and technologies of the XXI century (FIT21), which transfers most of the powers to supervise cryptocurrencies to another market regulator, commissions for commodity futures (CFTC).

The White House noted that the president will not impose a veto on this bill if the Senate is adopted.At the same time, Joe Biden already imposed a veto on the decision of the Congress on the abolition of another rule of SEC, which affects accounting in crypto companies.

So, last month, the House of Representatives and the Senate rejected the SEB 121 rule proposed by SEC, which orders the casteans to take into account the crypto actes of customers on their accounts as obligations.Legislators did not gain enough votes to overcome the presidential veto, and as a result, this norm remained valid.
