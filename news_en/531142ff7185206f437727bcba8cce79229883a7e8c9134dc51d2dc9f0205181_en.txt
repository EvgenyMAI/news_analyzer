Rule strengthening will continue to support OFZ
The week began with the strengthening-the approach of the tax period supported the national currency, which favorably affected the quotes of the State Bum: the profitability of medium-term and long OFZs decreased by 2-7 bp.(11.78% per annum);The profitability of short OFZs fell by 1-2 B.P.

Today, this factor will continue to support the debt market.Note that among important events on Wednesday there will be the results of OFZ auctions and traditional inflation data.We expect that the positive dynamics of the ruble will ensure the preservation of good demand for classic OFZ.However, in inflation, the situation remains difficult so far - the intrigue by decision of the Central Bank at the December meeting is maintained.

Demand is observed on corporate papers and in the primary market - yesterday Rostelecom (MCX :) (AA +/–) closed the book of applications for bonds for a period of 2.25 years with a coupon of 13.25%.However, the Prize to OFZ at the level of 177 b.p.Still almost twice as higher than historical values ​​in the company.Tomorrow we recommend paying attention to the release of Metalloinvest (AAA/ -) with a landmark of the floating coupon KS + 130 B.P.

As we noted earlier, we recommend that you maintain a prevailing share of the floors in the portfolio, gradually increasing the share of classic papers up to 3 years.
