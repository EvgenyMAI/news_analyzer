NVIDIA report will stir up the stock market
There was Shtil on the market yesterday: the volume of trading was reduced, and no significant movements of the quotations have occurred since the publication last week.Today we can expect revitalization taking into account the expiration of options on and publications at 18:00 according to Greenwich.

Investors had something to reflect on after yesterday’s speech by Chris Waller, who commented on the probability of a deferment of a decrease in the rates until the end of this or the beginning of the next year.Then Waller, on the eve of his performance on this subject on Friday, noted that the neutral rate can now be higher than previously expected.

All the leaders of the Fed, it seems, talk about the June point forecasts, which will probably show on average only one decrease in bets in 2024 and higher rates in the long -term period, and this will mean a fewer rate reduction in 2025.

Meanwhile, the 1-day Vix and 30-day VIX decreased the day before.However, if there were a 2-day Vix, he would probably indicate an increase in the implied volatility.On May 23, the volatility of options on with a fixed strik and expiration on May 23 testified to an increase in IV throughout the curve with a distort in favor of rising prices.This means that IV grew compared to the previous day stronger for growing than for decreasing prices.

The Call Delta by S&P 500 on Thursday marks the Delta Put, so the market, which is not surprising, is optimistic before publishing the NVIDIA report (NASDAQ :).With a decrease in IV, instead of falling the cost of options for the Put and the growth of the market, it seems to me, the cost of options of calls and the market will fall.

But “bullish” hopes can come true if NVIDIA reports on the results significantly better than expectations, will present more optimistic than analysts, the forecast will announce, for example, a shares of shares in a ratio of 10 to 1. However, to predict what the results and forecasts of NVIDIA will be, impossible.

In general, the market, probably, will again set in motion at the end of today and with a high degree of probability will make a breakdown on Thursday either with strong growth or with a strong fall.Given how low the volatility is now throughout the curve, the strong movement of the wide market, especially the fall, can be taken by surprise.
