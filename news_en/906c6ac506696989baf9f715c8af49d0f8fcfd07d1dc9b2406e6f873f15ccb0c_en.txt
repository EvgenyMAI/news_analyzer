OFZ quotes continue to grow, despite the preservation of inflationary risks
Active demand for OFZ is preserved-the profitability of the State Bum fell on Wednesday by 10-12 b.p.(11.53% - software, 11.72% - software).Investors continue to increase the rate of inflation in braking due to the tough policy of the Central Bank and the transition to the cycle of reducing the key rate next year.Demand at the auction of the Ministry of Finance for the release yesterday remained at a high level and amounted to 136 billion rubles.(Since the beginning of November, it is steadily exceeding 100 billion rubles).

In our opinion, the purchase of long OFZ for a period of 10 years with a profitability of 11.7% per annum is already risky.So far, the inflation impulse in the economy is preserved, and inflation according to the results of the year may exceed the forecast of the Central Bank (7.0% -7.5% at the end of the year).So, according to weekly data on November 20, the annual accelerated to 7.3%.Next year, the dual -fraction factor in the form of high budget expenditures will also be preserved.

At the same time, while there are no expectations in the market for an additional increase in the key rate - Roispix quotes up to 6 months indicates the preservation of a rate near the level of 15%.

We still recommend that you be careful when increasing investment in long papers with a fixed coupon-we recommend limiting the urgency of corporate securities for 3 years and shares in a portfolio of 25%-30%.The rest of the corporate floors will continue to bring stable income at 16% -17% per annum on the horizon up to 6 months.
