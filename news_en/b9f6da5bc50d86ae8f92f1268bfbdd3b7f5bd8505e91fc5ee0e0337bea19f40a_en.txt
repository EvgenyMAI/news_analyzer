Magnet
Magnet - results of 2023, dividends and target levels
For a long time we did not analyze the magnet with you.Today I propose to run on the fresh report of the company for 2023 and update the investment idea.Moreover, in conditions of persistent dunctional sentiments, the retail sector still looks promising.



So, the company's revenue over the reporting period increased by 8.2% to 2.5 trillion rubles.A fairly modest dynamics, given that over the same period, the revenue of the X5 (MCX :) Group increased by 20.8%, and in the tape (MCX :)) this indicator was 14.7%.Nevertheless, the magnet managed to circumvent official inflation in dynamics, which cannot but rejoice.



The results of LFL sales are also weak.Traffic increased by only 0.6%, the average check by 4.8%.The retailer continues to increase the number of stores.So, in 2023, the number of “shops near the house” increased by 7.4%, Dixie (MCX :) by 1.2%.In the segment of “hard discounters” B1, the magnet clearly loses the same X5, but tries to put this direction.The plans until the end of 2024 build up the number of stores from 70 to 300 pieces.



From the positive, one can note the reduction in other expenses by 5 billion rubles.This is caused by the high base of last year, when the magnet recorded a loss from the disposal of fixed assets and intangible assets.Together with the profit from exchange rate differences and interest income, the company increased net profit in IFRS by more than 2 times to 58.7 billion rubles.



However, Magnit is interesting differently.The company “shook” in the reporting period from the shareholders of unfriendly non -residents, having bought them with a large discount of 29.7% of their shares.This will make it possible to make decisions more flexible, exclude infrastructure risks for the company itself and maintain the practice of paying dividends.



In 2024, the shareholders already received 5.6% of dividend profitability.Given the growth of profit and low debt load (at the end of 2023, the index of net debt to the EBITDA amounted to 1.0x), the magnet can pay in the region of 900 rubles, which is about 11% of the profitability.Against the background of the rest of the retailers who do not pay dividends, the stocks of the magnet (MCX :) will also drive this factor.



As a result, we receive a moderately positive report, the understandable structure of shareholders and the ground for the formation of invest-ideas.To do this, it would be nice to wait for correction to the area of ​​7800 rubles.Below this mark I will consider shares in my portfolio.
