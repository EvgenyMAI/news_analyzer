Surgutneftegaz - in anticipation of record dividends
According to the Central Bank, the amount of funds of Russians in deposits exceeded a record 28 trillion rubles in 2023.Domestic investors actively build up the cube.The same applies to Surgutneftegaz (MCX :), the “cube” of which increased by 150 billion to 5.8 trillion rubles in only 1 quarter of 2024.Let's immediately analyze the company's report for this period.



So, the revenue of the company for RAS per quarter increased by 57.1% to 649.7 billion rubles.Not a record quarter, but such values ​​managed to achieve only once, in the 3rd quarter of 2023.Such dynamics is due to a high average course of oil sales in rubles in the first quarter.If in 2024 the average lasts above 90, then in 2023 the course barely exceeded the mark of 75 rubles.



The same formed the basis for recalculating the cubes and exchange rate revenues of the company.True, exchange rate reassessments were leveled by an increase in the cost of sales by 69.2% and other expenses, which increased 2.5 times to 343 yards.As a result, the net profit of the oil industry decreased by 29.9% to 268.6 billion rubles.



The dividends are only ungrateful in the first quarter, but we can already estimate the July payments for 2023.In 2023, the company received record net profit in the amount of 1.33 trillion rubles, which promises investors 12-12.5 rubles per privileged share or 17.8% - 18.6% of profitability at current prices.



VTB analysts (MCX :) are expected to have the average marriage of the Russian market on the horizon of 12 months in the amount of 9.4%, so the potential profitability of Surgut prefs is more than impressive.The Board of Directors will make a decision in June, and a positive decision on dividends will serve as another growth driver for quotations.



As for the report for the first quarter of 2024, the trend is clearly traced to reduce net profit due to the growth of the bones and the side of the currency.If we see the dollar rally by the end of the year, then Surgut will retain the right of dividend paper in 2024-2025.



I continue to keep the prefs for a long time, because according to my January study, the profitability of this case (an increase in the terminal value of shares + dividends) is able to overtake any other investment tool in the form of: the full profitability index of the Mosbirzhi, inflation, deposits and the yield of the currency.
