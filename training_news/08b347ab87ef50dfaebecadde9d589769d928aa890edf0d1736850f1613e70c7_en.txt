Oskombank - I expected more
The banking sector continues to publish its reports for the first quarter of 2024 and today we have on the analysis of the Sovcombank.Let's look at the report and the latest news around the company.A couple of moments confuse me, especially given the forecasts of analysts at a key rate.Let's start with it.



So, the key rate of the Central Bank holds at 16%, and in the coming months it is not worth waiting for its reduction.Officials and analysts of banks are waiting for the transition to the reduction cycle only by the end of the year.Let me remind you that the high “key” hits the interest expenses of banks, reducing performance indicators.



So the Sukombank, no longer awaits net profit in 2024 at the level of 2023 due to the high rate of the Central Bank.An alarming call, which is worth it to be followed, but let's not run ahead and study the results for the first quarter.



The company's interest revenues increased almost 2 times to 106.5 billion rubles.It looks like the synergistic effect of the integration of the Home Bank is fruit.However, interest expenses due to the influence of a high “key” increased at all by 3 times to 86 yards, which leveled the growth of income.As a result, net interest income increased by only 11.6% to 31.9 billion rubles.



The bank also increased reserves for 5 billion credit losses, reduced net commission income by 1 billion and 11.1 billion net profit on financial instruments, foreign currency and metals.Pure profit from “non -banking activities” (insurance, leasing, etc.) remained at the level of last year.All this led to a reduction in profit to tax by 5% to 26.4 billion rubles.



The bank also said that he plans to double the amount of additional ministry, which will go to pay for the second part of the transaction on the purchase of the KHF Bank.2 billion shares are not so critical, but tangible.But the desire of majority to sell its shares to increase Free Float to 10% seems to be a logical step in the market, but you need to wait for the details.



The bank report for the first quarter caused me ambiguous feelings.A decrease in a number of financial metrics is predictable and caused by a negative conjuncture, which the SOCCOMBAK itself cannot affect.However, I expected more successful results from a fast -growing company.
