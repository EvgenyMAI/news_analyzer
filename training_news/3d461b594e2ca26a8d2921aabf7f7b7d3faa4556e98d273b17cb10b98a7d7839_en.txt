OFZ quotes are reduced after the ruble
Correction in the OFZ market on Tuesday continued-the Gosbumag curve rose by another 10-12 bp, reaching 12.0% per annum in the area of ​​3 years.The weakening of the ruble leads to an increase in inflation expectations and the probability of an additional increase in the rate at the Central Bank meeting on December 15.

Shortly in the coming days we expect to preserve the pressure on the quotes of the State Bum in connection with the continuation of correction in the foreign exchange market.We also expect today to reduce demand at the auction of the Ministry of Finance, which will place a long 14-year classic release.

We still give preference to papers with a floating bet;We recommend that you approach bonds with a fixed coupon carefully, limited to the urgency of papers of 3 years and a share in a portfolio of up to 30%.
