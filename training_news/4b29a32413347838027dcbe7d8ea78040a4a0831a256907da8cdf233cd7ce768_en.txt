The prosecutor of the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, said that 46-year-old resident of Florida Juan Tacuri found himself guilty of one point of accusation of fraud using electronic communications.A man faces the maximum punishment up to 20 years in prison.Takuri agreed to return $ 4 million to his victims, as well as real estate purchased at investors.

Takuri and other Forcount promoters guaranteed investors that their investments would double for six months.The prosecutor's office claims that Takuri traveled to the United States, arranging luxurious exhibitions to search for new investors, luring them with promises of “financial freedom”.Later it turned out that Forcount had never been engaged in mining and cryptototrading.Takuri and their partners used the money of new investors to pay to the early depositors, and also wasted out the money attracted for real estate and a luxurious lifestyle.
