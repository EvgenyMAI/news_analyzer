A national analogue of CFA will appear in Russia
In Russia, an analogue of the CFA certificate will appear.CFA is an international document that confirms the qualifications of financiers.Since 2022, for obvious reasons, certification in Russia is not carried out.At the same time, Russians can still undergo international certification.However, this has become much more difficult to do after 2022.To do this, the examiners need to go abroad and pay for the service with cards of foreign banks.You can hand over in those countries that are published on the CFA website.Each time they can change, but by and large it is traditionally Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan.Recently, verified information has appeared that the Russian National Financial Association, together with partners, intends to develop its version of testing.



They plan to create a program based on the needs of the domestic market, and they will only be to conduct an exam for all applicants once a year.Naturally, when the requirement for the exam is ready, applicants will be able to request blocks of information in the NFA that you need to know, a list of all educational institutions and those who are engaged in training.The emphasis will probably be made on technical analysis, crypto will be examined in detail.The task is that the program that will be given to meet the modern issues of the financial market and, if necessary, changes.In the foreign version of CFA there are many complex financial models, the practical benefit of which when evaluating Russian actions is controversial.This is especially true for fast -growing companies in the high -tech sector of Astra or Positive Technologies.In Russia, evaluative multipliers work well, but the models of discounted cash flows are generally rarely applicable.Often they simply drive up to the desired analytics or his boss result.At the same time, CFA as it was and remains a foreign certificate.We are talking about an internal document that is more focused on issues related to the domestic market.



The real plus CFA always gave, first of all, to applicants for analytical departments of investment companies.Initially, almost all Russian investment companies served, first of all, Western, English -speaking customers.Even analytical reviews were originally produced in English.And only a few days later the Russian version appeared.The presence of CFA from a senior analyst or the head of the analytical department of the investment company was a certain quality sign for Western investors that the analytics and wider this financial company can be trusted.Their fears are clear.Thirty years ago, some Russian financiers did not distinguish the action from the bond.This and now the leading business and financial news is sometimes sinful.



CFA certificate consists of three levels of complexity.The exam is passed for each of them in turn.The attempt is paid and is from $ 900 to $ 1250.Russian certification will probably be cheaper.At the same time, many participants in the stock market doubt that the exam on Russian CFA will be organized at the same level as the foreign analogue.



At the same time, the work of investment analyst in Russia and in the West is very different.In the West, it is more like an accountant’s work.Analysis of financial statements and a specific recommendation ‘’ buy ’’, ‘’ to keep ’’ or ‘’ sell ’’ specific action.Sometimes the recommendation can be softer - ‘’ is better than the market ’’ or ‘’ worse than the ’’ market.Analysting reviews are boring and resemble annual annual reports of companies.In Russia, everything is different.Analysting reviews often contain winged expressions and a personal position on politics and macroeconomics.Often analysts of leading investment companies appear on television and lead copyright columns in leading business and political publications.Sometimes it comes out sideways.For example, in 2018, Sberbank CIB analyst Alexander Fek resigned from the company because of a report in which the main beneficiaries of large projects of Gazprom (MCX :) were called contractors of the company.Sber (mcx :) just decided not to quarrel with a gas giant.
