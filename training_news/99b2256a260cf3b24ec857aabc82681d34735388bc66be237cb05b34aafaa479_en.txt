With the approach of the meeting of the Central Bank, the inversion of the OFZ curve increases
Investors in OFZs continue to record profit with the approach of the Central Bank meeting and an increase in the risks of raising the key rate on December 15.Based on the incoming data (weekly inflation, lending rates, etc.), we consider equal scenari to the preservation of the key rate unchanged and its increase at the December meeting.An additional negative factor for the State Bum - deprivation of support from the ruble with the end of the November tax period.

As a result, the inversion of the OFZ curve increases due to the advanced increase in the profitability of short and medium-term papers (+11-17 B.P. On Monday), the profitability increased by 2 B.P.- up to 11.9% per annum.We expect that the quotes of the State Bum will remain under pressure in the near future.

In this situation, we recommend that you save the floaters as the basis of a bond portfolio;An increase in the proportion of papers with a fixed rate (up to 30%) is advisable to resume after the regulator meeting.
