Correction in the US stock market has long been ripened


The USA reporting season is already coming to an end.79% of all companies included in, and the profit of three quarters of these companies exceeded the expectations of analysts.So far, this is below the average for 5 years, which is 77%, but after the report of all companies, this figure, of course, may increase.On such results, the US stock markets recorded the next historical records, S&P500 futures increased to 5050.6.



But you can notice that the growth of the profit of companies began to slow down.On average, the profit made exceeded the forecasts by 3.9%, which is weaker than average indicators for 5 years and 10 years, which account for 8.9% and 6.7%, respectively.And, most likely, this figure by the end of the reporting period will not be able to seriously grow, most large companies have already reported.



The mood of the market regarding the prospects of the market is ambiguous.Managing funds and began to increase long positions on the futures of the S&P500, and private investors, on the contrary, began to reduce long positions and increase short ones.After the reporting season of serious drivers for the further growth of the stock market may not appear, which means that the prerequisites for correction in the stock markets may appear.



Hopes for a speedy softening of monetary policy also faded away, before the summer the rate the rate is not worth waiting until the summer.Moreover, conversations returned that the Fed’s rate could be increased again.The former head of the US finance, Larry Summers, said that such a scenario cannot be excluded, since the dynamics of inflation is still too unstable.



Against the background of all these conversations, the demand for US government bonds has grown, and stock markets began to be adjusted.On February 12, a “falling star” was formed on the S&P500 index of the S&P500 index, which has already provoked the drop in the index.After the index made an attempt to continue growth, but to no avail.Yesterday, the S&P500 quotes broke the line of trend growing since November last year and are now trading below it.And between the index schedule and the AO indicator, a strong divergence has long been formed.All this suggests that the correction on the S&P500 has long ripened and now, perhaps, we are observing the very beginning of this phase.The index quotes can drop to the level of support to 4845, and in the case of this level passage, the next goal may be 4710.
