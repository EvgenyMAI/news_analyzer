Techigigans cannot yet support the S&P500
The reporting season began in the United States.63% of experts interviewed by Bloomberg expect that this season will be successful for the US stock market, and according to its results, the index will grow.However, while we are observing the reverse picture.



The first to traditionally report large US banks.And there the results were ambiguous.The income of the largest banks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (Nyse :), JP Morgan and Bank of America (Nyse :)) exceeded expectations.But the Bank of America shares negatively reacted to the reporting, as the bank expects that its pure percentage revenue may decrease.



This week, the company's technological sector began to report.Most companies that have been reported this week have exceeded forecasts and net profit.Only Tesla (Nasdaq :) showed the result below the expected one, the company's revenue amounted to $ 21.3 billion against a forecast of $ 22.27 billion, and a profit per share - $ 0.45 instead of $ 0.49, the lowest indicator over the past two years.However, other companies reporting this week showed not their best result.



The net profit of IBM (NYSE :) compared to previous quarters fell.However, the first quarter of this company is traditionally weaker than the subsequent ones.Intel (Nasdaq :)) collapsed from $ 0.54 to $ 0.18, and Microsoft (Nasdaq :) has grown from $ 2.93 to $ 2.94, but, as we see, the growth is minimal.But Googl showed a good result, in comparison with the previous quarter, the pure arrived increased by more than 15%.



Of course, not all technological companies have already reported, but it is already noticeable that the profitability of this sector is weakening.According to JP Morgan, the strongest by historical standards for the sale of shares of the technological sector are already observed.But it was this sector in the last year or two that was the driver of the US stock market, occupying more than 30% of the S&P500 index.Sales in this sector can provoke serious correction in the stock market.



As can be seen from the schedule, the Futures S&P500 have already crossed a 50-day sliding average and is traded under it.Good reports by Microsoft and Google (Nasdaq :) did not manage to provide sufficient support to the index, which has grown up in recent days, but remained lower than the average and line of the descending trend.And if the reports of the remaining giants of the technological sector are weak, then it can be assumed that the C&P500 correction will continue.Quotes can decrease to the level of Fibonacci 38.2% on at the mark 4880 or even to the level of Fibonacci 50%, which intersects with a 200-day sliding average of 4740. Otherwise, a return to 5270 is possible.
